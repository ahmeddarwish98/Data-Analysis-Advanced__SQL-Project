# Data-Analysis-Advanced__SQL-Project
project 1 - Chinook Database - Data Analysis Advanced nanodegree offered by FWD Egypt &amp; Udacity.

here will be two parts to this project.

      + The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. Though these questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer, they will help you self-assess.
      
      + The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project.  then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question. The essentials of your project submission are discussed in the next sections. 
      
presentation should include:

    + Four slides
    + One visualization per slide
    + A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
    + The SQL query is used to create the data used in the visualization.
    
The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
